                Count the quality, not calories
                Whether you lose weight or gain weight, it all depends on your food intake. “The quality of the food you
                consume is more important than the actual `number' of calories contained in it. Nuts, whole grains,
                avocado, mango, banana, olive oil and eggs are some examples of foods that are high in calories but are
                healthy . So, choose your calories wisely ,“ says Suneetha.
